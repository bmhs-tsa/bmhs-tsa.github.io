We are the [Battle Mountain High School](https://www.eagleschools.net/schools/battle-mountain-high-school) chapter of the [Student Technology Association](https://tsaweb.org).

## Activities

### Capture The Flag (CTF)
CTFs are fun and a great way for us to gain cybersecurity skills which is why we 
participate in them. Currently, we've participated in [picoCTF 2021](https://picoctf.org/competitions/2021-spring.html)
and hope to compete in more CTFs in the future.

### eSports
eSports promote team-work, problem solving skills, and of course they're fun.

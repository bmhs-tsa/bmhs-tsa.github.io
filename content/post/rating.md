We rank CTF challenges on the following metrics:
* Artificialness
* Skill
* Time

## Artificialness
This metric measures how contrived or artificial a challenge is. This metric is
measured on a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 represents a very realistic challenge
while a 10 represents a very artificial challenge.

## Skill
This metric measures how much skill a challenge requires to solve. If multiple
ways of solving a challenge are available, this metrics should reflect the easiest
one. This metric is also measured on a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 represents a
challenge a complete novice could solve and a 10 represents a challenge only subject
experts could solve.

## Time
This metric measures how much time a challenge requires to solve on the first time
without any outside help. This metric is measured in hours and minutes.

If you don\u0026rsquo;t you, should check out Web Gauntlet 2.\nWhat is XPath? XPath is the standard way of querying data from an XML document (Similar to SQL). There are a few basic things you need to know about XPath:\n Think of XPath queries like a file-path (/ separated, items are written in a descending, hierarchical-order) A / represents the root element A // represents any element in any location You can extract an element\u0026rsquo;s content with {Element}/text() (eg: //user/name/text() equals guest) You can get a string\u0026rsquo;s length with string-length (eg: string-length('abc') equals 3) You can get a substring with substring (eg: substring('abc', 2, 1) equals b; note: XPath is one-indexed) You filter elements with [{Condition}]  You can filter by position with [position() {Operator} {Number}] (eg: [position() = 2]; note: XPath is one-indexed) You can filter by string-matches with ['A' = 'B'] You can join different conditions together with or or and    Solving the challenge Probable Query In order to develop an injection, it helps to have a query (Although it likely won\u0026rsquo;t be the same as the actual query picoCTF uses). To develop it, think about what conditions the server uses to find a user element: does the user\u0026rsquo;s name equal a user-controlled valued and does the user\u0026rsquo;s password equal another user-controlled value? The probable query I developed was:\n//user[name/text()=\u0026#39;[USERNAME INPUT]\u0026#39; and pass/text()=\u0026#39;[PASSWORD INPUT]\u0026#39;] Developing an injection Now that we have a probably query, we can start messing around with single-quote injection to try to escape the user-controlled strings. I found using abc as the username and ' or {CONDITION} and 'a'='a as the password allows for us to run arbitrary boolean expressions on the server (Note that You're on the right path. indicates true while Login failure. indicates false). While this doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow us to return strings, it\u0026rsquo;s a start.\nExfiltrating data We know we can evaluate a boolean expression but how can we extract a string? The answer is by testing each character in a string until we get the correct character and with enough characters, the entire string.\nInitially it may seem like this a place where binary search would work well - we could possibly check if the nth character code is greater than the a certain number however the fn:string-to-codepoints function is disabled. Therefore, we will have to go through each character sequentially (Linear search). This is the part where this challenge gets very painful. The good news is that we can reasonably assume all characters are inside of the printable ASCII range (97 characters) which is far easier to guess than say Unicode (143,859 characters).\nTo expedite this process, I developed a mini library for data extraction specifically for this challenge. You can view the source code here. This took a long time to extract because I followed multiple incorrect paths (Hence the flag\u0026rsquo;s message); but I did find this XML playground to be extremely helpful for constructing XPath queries.

This article assumes you\u0026rsquo;ve already solved Web Gauntlet 2.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s different? Not a whole lot - just the maximum user input length. Our previous exploit (admi'||CHAR(1540/LENGTH( and ))||') is 29 characters long. We only need to shave off 4 characters to be within the 25 character limit, that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too hard.\nCondensing our payload The first thing I noticed is that the bridged string ( AND password=) contains 1 of the characters in admin: a. Since SQLite also has a SUBSTR function, we can use that bridged text meaning we can eliminate CHAR(1540/LENGTH()). This leaves us with:\nSELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username=\u0026#39;\u0026#39;||substr(\u0026#39; AND password=\u0026#39;,7,1)||\u0026#39;dmin\u0026#39;; Now the total input is only 22 characters, 3 under the limit.

SQL injections occur when a server improperly handles user input in such a way that the user can write SQL queries and run them on the server. For example, lets say we\u0026rsquo;re running a simple web server that performs a username/password lookup:\nSELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username=\u0026#39;[USERNAME INPUT]\u0026#39; AND password=\u0026#39;[PASSWORD INPUT]\u0026#39;; Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t know SQL, you can probably figure out that we\u0026rsquo;re querying the database for users with a username equal to [USERNAME INPUT] and a password equal to [PASSWORD INPUT]. Well, say an attacker were to enter '. Just a single-quote. What do you think would happen? If the server was programmed correctly, it would escape the quote or filter it out resulting in the following query:\nSELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username=\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; AND password=\u0026#39;[PASSWORD INPUT]\u0026#39;; Note: you escape single-quotes by doubling them up in SQLite.\nBut if the server simply concatenates or adds strings together to form a query such as with the below pseudocode:\n\u0026#34;SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username=\u0026#39;\u0026#34; + username + \u0026#34;\u0026#39; AND password=\u0026#39;\u0026#34; + password + \u0026#34;\u0026#39;;\u0026#34; This would produce the following query:\nSELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username=\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; AND password=\u0026#39;[PASSWORD INPUT]\u0026#39;; Note: this is actually an invalid query but bare with me.\nNotice how the syntax highlighting is different than when the server properly escapes the single-quote? That\u0026rsquo;s because we now have a single string starting with an escaped quote ('' AND password=). This is called an injection vulnerability because a crafty attacker could format the username or password in such a way that when the server concatenates the user-input together, it generates a totally different, malicious query.\nSolving the challenge One important thing to note about this challenge is that our user-input cannot contain any of the following or and true false union like = \u0026gt; \u0026lt; ; -- /* */ admin (Which can be found on the filter.php page).\nSetting the username So first we need to figure out how to query the admin user without actually typing admin (Because it\u0026rsquo;s filtered). Luckily, SQLite (The flavor of SQL this challenge uses) supports string concatenation (Adding two or more strings together). So now we can type admin with the following for the username: admi'||'n which will turn into:\nSELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username=\u0026#39;admi\u0026#39;||\u0026#39;n\u0026#39; AND password=\u0026#39;[PASSWORD INPUT]\u0026#39;; Sweet!\nSetting the password We don\u0026rsquo;t know the password and this challenge isn\u0026rsquo;t about getting the password, so we need to get more creative - think about ways of removing the AND part of the query.\nRemember how earlier when the attacker entered a single-quote (') it generated an invalid SQL query because the string kind of bridged the 2 user inputs? Well if we do something with that string, then that eliminates the password= part of the query meaning we don\u0026rsquo;t have to guess or crack the password.\nMy solution is far from elegant but I decided to kill 2 birds with one stone by using the length of the bridged string using the SQLite LENGTH function in combination with the SQLite CHAR function to generate the n in admin via character codes.\nIn essence, the bridged string is  AND password= (14 characters long) and the ASCII character code for n is 110. So then I multiplied 14 by 110 which is 1540. Finally I concatenated an empty string at the end to make sure there wasn\u0026rsquo;t an unmatched single-quote. When the server executes the query, it will undo the multiplication and return the correct character code. I know this sounds confusing but it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat simple when you see it written out:\nSELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username=\u0026#39;admi\u0026#39;||CHAR(1540/LENGTH(\u0026#39; AND password=\u0026#39;))||\u0026#39;\u0026#39;; So if you set the username to admi'||CHAR(1540/LENGTH( and the password to ))||', you should see the flag on filter.php. Again, not the most elegant solution. If you want to see a more elegant solution, check out the sequel to this challenge, Web Gauntlet 3.\n","date":"2021-03-30T23:26:46-06:00","permalink":"https://bmhstsa.com/post/web-gauntlet-2/","title":"Web Gauntlet 2"},{"content":"Challenge Rating  Artificialness: 5/10 Skill: 3/10 Time: 5 minutes  Learn more about how we rate challenges here.\nWhat are HTTP verbs? Normally when you access a website, your browser makes an HTTP request to GET content from the server. However, your browser isn\u0026rsquo;t always fetching data from a server, sometimes it POSTs data too (Such as when logging in to a website). HTTP verbs are the standardized method for telling the server what to do. The most common HTTP verbs are:\n GET: fetch data from a server (eg: retrieve an HTML file) HEAD: check what the server will do before making a GET request (eg: check response size before fetching something) POST: post data to a server (eg: log in to a website) PUT: update an existing resource DELETE: delete a resource  Solving the challenge Although the Get in Get Ahead may throw you off, remember that web browsers make GET requests by default so this challenge may be a little too easy if all you had to do was just visit the link with a browser and open the inspector. Instead, focus on the Ahead part - as in a HEAD request.

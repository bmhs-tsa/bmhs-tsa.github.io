What are HTTP verbs? Normally when you access a website, your browser makes an HTTP request to GET content from the server. However, your browser isn&amp;rsquo;t always fetching data from a server, sometimes it POSTs data too (Such as when logging in to a website). HTTP verbs are the standardized method for telling the server what to do.</description></item><item><title>Rating</title><link>https://bmhstsa.com/post/rating/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 22:31:14 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bmhstsa.com/post/rating/</guid><description>We rank CTF challenges on the following metrics:
Artificialness Skill Time Artificialness This metric measures how contrived or artificial a challenge is. This metric is measured on a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 represents a very realistic challenge while a 10 represents a very artificial challenge.
Skill This metric measures how much skill a challenge requires to solve. If multiple ways of solving a challenge are available, this metrics should reflect the easiest one.</description></item></channel></rss>
